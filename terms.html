    <h1>OneAnswerAI - Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>
    <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Valentino Paulon</p>

    <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using OneAnswerAI, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the app.</p>

    <h2>Service Description</h2>
    <p>OneAnswerAI is an intelligent assistant that simultaneously queries three AI providers — OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude — then fuses the responses into a single optimized answer. The app provides AI-generated content for informational purposes only and does not constitute professional, medical, legal, or financial advice.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>AI responses are generated by third-party models and may contain inaccuracies, errors, or inappropriate content. Users assume full responsibility for how they use and act upon the responses provided. OneAnswerAI and its developer shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use of this service.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The OneAnswerAI app, its design, code, and branding are the intellectual property of Valentino Paulon. AI-generated responses are provided by third-party services and are subject to their respective terms. You retain ownership of the content you submit (queries, documents, images).</p>

    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>OneAnswerAI offers the following auto-renewable subscription plans:</p>
    <ul>

        <li><strong>Monthly Pro ($17.00/month):</strong> 40 text queries/day, 3 media queries/day, no ads, access to additional query packs</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Payment:</strong> Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase.</p>
    <p><strong>Renewal:</strong> Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.</p>
    <p><strong>Management:</strong> You can manage or cancel your subscription in iOS Settings &gt; [Your Name] &gt; Subscriptions.</p>

    <h2>Consumable Purchases</h2>
    <p>Query packs are one-time purchases that add credits to your account. Once credited, they are non-refundable. Refund requests must be directed to Apple through their standard refund process.</p>

    <h2>Free Tier</h2>
    <p>All users receive 5 free text queries per day. The daily quota resets at midnight UTC. Media queries (images and documents) are not included in the free tier.</p>

    <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose</li>
        <li>Submit illegal, harmful, or abusive content</li>
        <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the app</li>

        <li>Use automated systems or bots to access the service</li>
        <li>Resell or redistribute AI responses commercially without authorization</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Service Availability</h2>
    <p>OneAnswerAI is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. We do not guarantee uninterrupted service availability. AI providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) may change their services or become temporarily unavailable.</p>

    <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to update these terms at any time. Continued use of the service after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms. Significant changes will be communicated through the app or this page.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Italy. Any disputes arising from these terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of Italian courts.</p>
